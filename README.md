# Tech Radar

Inspired by thoughtworks tech radar this project is intended to be used by anyone who wants to build their own tech radar.

The project has two main sections client and server. The client side is an angular based application made up of the following

- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) as a client-side module builder and module loader.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a package manager and task runner (say [**NO**](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/) to gulp/grunt).
- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) 6 as a transpiler from ES6 to ES5.
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) as a virtual Dom JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (views).
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) as an incredibly simple way of modelling your data app state, with great community support.
- [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) as a live-editing environment for your Redux apps.
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) as a reporter for syntax and style issues. [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) for additional React specific linting rules.
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) as a compiler of CSS styles with variables, mixins, and more.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as a test framework.
- [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) as a BDD assertion library that works along with `Mocha`.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/skpullano/evules.git
$ cd client
$ npm install
```

## Development

There are two ways in which you can build and run the web app:

* Build once for (ready for ***Production***):
  * `$ npm run build`
  * Open `build/index.html` through the local webserver


* Hot reloading via webpack dev server:
  * `$ npm start`
  * Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/, page hot reloads automatically when there are changes

## Testing

To execute all unit tests, use:

```sh
npm run test
```

To run unit tests continuously during development (watch tests), use:

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

### How do I deploy this?

`npm run build`. This will prepare and build the project for production use. It does the following:

- Minifies all JS and CSS
- Inline base64 URLs for images and fonts if their size is less than specified limit
- Sets NODE_ENV to `production` so that React is built in production mode
- Places the resulting built project files into `/build` directory. (This is the folder you'll expose to the world).
